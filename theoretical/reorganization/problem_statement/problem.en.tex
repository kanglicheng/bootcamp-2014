\problemname{Reorganization}
Alice and Bob own a huge company. This company was losing money consistently over the last 30
years, since its owners spent too much time playing games with mathematicians. Alice and Bob
decide to make a change.

Alice and Bob start by giving unique ID to each employee. Then, Alice and Bob give unique ranks to
each employee. Each rank $R$ is an integer such that $1 \le R \le 10\,000\,000$. After this, they
plan to reorganize the company, by making sure that the employees satisfy the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is exactly one director, who has no supervisor;
\item Except for the director, each employee has a supervisor, and this supervisor has a smaller
employee ID and a higher rank (the value of rank is smaller); and
\item Each employee can supervise at most 2 people.
\end{enumerate}

Alice and Bob are eager to know whether their company can be reorganized successfully.

\section*{Input}
The input is a total of $n + 1$ lines. The first line contains $n$ $(1 \le n \le 500\,000)$,
indicating the number of employees. On the next $n$ lines are $n$ distinct integers $R$ $(1 \le R
\le 10\,000\,000)$, one integer per line, where the $i$th integer indicates the rank of the employee
with ID $i$.

For partial credit you may assume that $n\le 5\,000$.

\section*{Output}
Output YES if the company can be reorganized successfully; output NO otherwise.
