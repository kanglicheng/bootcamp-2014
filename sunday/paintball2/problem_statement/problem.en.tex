\problemname{Paintball II}

You are playing paintball on a $1000\times 1000$ square field.  A number of your opponents are on the
field hiding behind trees at various positions. Each opponent can fire a paintball a certain
distance in any direction. Can you cross the field without being hit by a paintball?

Assume that the southwest corner of the field is at $(0,0)$ and the northwest corner at $(0,1000)$.

\section*{Input}
The input consists of a line containing $1\le n \le 1000$, the number of opponents.  A line follows
for each opponent, containing three real numbers:  the $(x,y)$ location of the opponent and its
firing range.  The opponent can hit you with a paintball if you ever pass within his firing range.

You must enter the field somewhere between the southwest and northwest corner and must leave
somewhere between the southeast and northeast corners.

\section*{Output}
If you can complete the trip, output four real numbers with two digits after the decimal place, the
coordinates at which you may enter and leave the field, separated by spaces.  If you can enter and
leave at several places, give the most northerly.  If there is no such pair of positions, print a
line containing ``\texttt{IMPOSSIBLE}''.
