\problemname{Sky sensors}

In a far galaxy planets are much more populated then in our. 
Every planet has his own government. 
The rule over the space is organized in the following way: 
Every point in space belongs to the nearest planet.

Life-forms of the planet U5 are very egocentric and skeptic against others.
They have a cartesian coordinate system with the center of their planet as point of origin.
They want to place a spy sensor in their own space but in a specific direction.
The sensors should be as far in this direction as possible
(far in a direction means, that the scalar product of the position an the direction is high).
The government of U5 ask you to write a program that calculates the optiomal spy point with the positions of all relevant planets and the spy direction. 

\section*{Input}

The Input starts with the number of testcases.
Every testcase starts with the number $n$ ($n$ smaller than 100) of neighboring planets.
Than n lines follow with the coordinates of the planets.
Than a line with the spy direction ends the testcase.
Every testcase has a unique solution.

\section*{Output}
Output for every testcase the coordinates of the optimal spy point.
The absolut or relative error must be smaller than $10^{-6}$
